# MalayalamRomanizer

## Why this project interests me and what does it do?

Since I was born and raised as a third culture kid, I sometimes have difficulties when reading Malayalam (my mother-tongue).
So, I came up with an idea to transliterate Malayalam words into English for my easy reading. This application automates that procedure.


## Who can use it?

Anybody who is interested in learning how to read Malayalam or needs assistance with it.

## Technical Specifications and User Stories

The program is 100% built on Java and JavaSwing. The GUI uses menu bars, scrollable text-areas, buttons and tabs to accomplish the task. The user can:

- Input words in Malayalam (by typing it in the input pane or by importing it from a text file i.e. ProverbsInMalayalam.txt).
- View the romanized output in the output pane by clicking a button.
- Save the output as a text file.
- Clear the input pane if they wish to enter more text.
- View the various shortcuts.
- Exit the program.
